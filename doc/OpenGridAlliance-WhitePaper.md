# Open Grid Alliance White Paper

## Motivation

XXX
* IT Admin more complex => Heise Beruicht über alte technology
  Kein Personal, Teurer
* Power more costly => Concentration brings benefit
* Closing the Gap between common cloud and on- prem


## Closing the Gap between On-Site and Cloud

During the last years a lot of compute workload and services were
moved to the cloud. This makes sense where there are no special
requirements for throughput, latency or amount of data to be
transferred.

Cloud computing gives a lot advantages like lower costs, pay-per-use
and dynamic workload handling without invest.  On the other side
on-site installation provides data privacy and sovereignty paired with
low latency and no additional costs for data-transfer.

Establishing the Open Grid fills this gap.  It provides on-site 
features with the advantages of the cloud by bringing compute power
close to the site leveraging up-to date technologies like 5G or direct
fiber connections.

* Close the Gap

* Move non IT workloads to the cloud

* high realiability / high availability

* Green: use power where it is generated

* Green: concentrate workloads

* Green: Switch off sites which are not needed

* Run workloads near your customer
