# Mission & Vision

The construct we are building has two aspects – it is a Grid and a
Utility. As a grid, it combines resources from various administrative
and technological domains. The focus here is on sharing resources and
services. As a utility, it provides ubiquitous access to resources and
services on demand. The focus here is to acquire resources. In
combination, it is a facility that is being provided to applications
to help them achieve their goals while creating added value for
resource owners and operators. The Grid’s infrastructure is a
combination of operating system, cloud-computing, networking, and
distributed system including their management.

The Grid enables and targets hyper-composed applications - dynamically
composed applications with the ‘right type’ of resources in the ‘right
amount’, in the ‘right place’, and at the ‘right time’, with
intelligent optimization across all four dimensions at all
times. Applications developed edge-native do use composition and the
Grid extends this to hyper-composition.

* Distributed, federated, parallel, circular, context: [security,
  protect people, privacy], resilience, flexible 
* Fungible, organic
* Privacy + sovereignty [privacy, e.g. temperature reading OK for GP
  but not OK for general public] 
* Context has time dimension!
* Monitoring, accounting, charging, billing -> context / purpose
  (e.g. charity vs. profit) 
* Context is a shifting window in time
* SLA decentralized
* What environmental / sustainable variables are part of the Grid
* Supply-chain constraints

# The OGA Purpose

Today's Internet is primarily a communication vehicle; it is not yet ready for planet-scale automation.
What is needed is an openly developed and widely shared foundation for the development of personalized and intelligent solutions for everyone.
The Open Grid will be a living entity, with a circulatory system that stitches together all digital resources owned and managed by different entities
across many parts of the world,
and with a nervous system that facilitates collaboration between
all of these "local brains" that run and operate these connectivity systems.

To achieve this, we must devise new and recursive approaches
for planning, designing and operating these systems with high degrees of autonomy.
We must assess all these technological change vectors and harmonize them to build the Open Grid.

# OGA's Approach

The OGA assesses, monetizes, and evolves
various technologies including radio, web, compute, AI/ML and many more to achieve automation at global scale.
It defines key principles for the Open Grid,
identifies interoperable technologies that adhere to those principles,
instantiates those technologies in physical environments, and demonstrates their efficacy.
To accelerate time-to-market and innovate new public/private business models,
the OGA also partners with cities and municipalities to create Innovation Zones.

The organization also performs research,
including the production of economic impact reports
and addressable market models that members and municipalities can use
to predict opportunities and outcomes.

The OGA also builds reference architectures
and coordinates with its members to develop collaborative go-to-market offerings.
As the OGA proves out new technologies,
it documents how these technologies will impact cloud providers, developers,
vendors, communication service providers (CSPs), internet service providers (ISPs), and end users.

# Introduction and Motivation

At its inception in Summer 2021,
the Open Grid Alliance sparked a groundswell of industry support
with its *Open Grid Manifesto* (https://bit.ly/Open-Grid-Manifesto).
By the end of the year, the organization had attracted over 30 founding member companies
and became a 501(c)4 non-profit organization.
By September 2022, the organization had formed its four key workstreams:
the Grid Think Tank, Grid Innovation Zone, Grid Industry Development and Grid Market Development.
Soon thereafter Las Vegas, Nevada was designated as the OGA’s first Innovation Zone,
which published the market analysis paper *Monetizing the Open Grid in Las Vegas* (https://bit.ly/monetizing-the-grid),
and demonstrated a real-time video conferencing system over 5G CBRS using Open Grid technologies.

# Call for Actions

The Open Grid can only come about through deep collaboration and open architectures.
While many Open Grid technologies are being implemented today,
it will be a decades-long journey of innovation that will touch all levels of the stack,
from fiber optics to AI-driven workload automation.

For hardware providers, the Open Grid provides close proximity
distributed datacenter locations with last mile connectivity to reach
the end customer.  For software providers, the Open Grid enables your
software stack to be pre-integrated into an end to end solution for
the enterprise customer.  For data center operators, being part of the
Open Grid increases your ability to reach end customer sites and help
the end customer finish their digital transformation by moving the
last workloads offsite. For last mile service providers, being part of
the Open Grid enhances your product offering and increases your
revenue stream with pre-integrated solutions offered through the Open
Grid.  The OGA invites you to join our efforts to make this vision of
evolving the Internet for a better future for everyone across the
globe!
