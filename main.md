# The Challenge

Today's Internet is primarily a communication vehicle; it is not yet ready for planet-scale automation.

The challenge we face is that the current Internet Infrastructure is
not optimized to support the demands of an Immersive Experience world,
where automation at a planetary scale is required. We must find ways
to upgrade and evolve our Internet Infrastructure to meet the needs of
this rapidly changing landscape, and unlock the transformative
potential of immersive technologies power for everyone, everywhere.

This requires a commitment to innovation, collaboration, and
continuous improvement in order to create a more resilient and
adaptable internet.

# Our Mission

Our mission at the OGA is to revolutionize the internet by
constructing a comprehensive grid and utility that integrates diverse
administrative and technological domains, ultimately transforming the
way the internet functions to improve quality of life.

To achieve this mission, we must devise new and recursive approaches
for planning, designing and operating these systems with high degrees
of autonomy.  We must assess all these technological change vectors
and harmonize them to build this grid and utility, which we call the
Open Grid.

[//]: # (Utility. As a grid, it combines resources from various administrative)

# Our Vision

Our vision is to empower individuals and organizations around the
world to achieve their full potential by providing open, innovative,
and personalized solutions that harness the power of artificial
intelligence and other emerging technologies. As the world's most
openly developed and widely shared foundation for digital
transformation, we strive to democratize access to advanced
technologies and enable everyone to participate in the creation of a
smarter, more connected, and more equitable world.

# Our Strategy

The Grid enables and targets hyper-composed applications - dynamically
composed applications with the ‘right type’ of resources in the ‘right
amount’, in the ‘right place’, and at the ‘right time’, with
intelligent optimization across all four dimensions at all
times. Applications developed edge-native do use composition and the
Grid extends this to hyper-composition.

* Distributed, federated, parallel, circular, context: security,
  protect people, privacy, resilience, flexible 
* Fungible, organic
* Privacy + sovereignty 

* Context has time dimension!
* Monitoring, accounting, charging, billing -> context / purpose
  (e.g. charity vs. profit) 
* Context is a shifting window in time
* SLA decentralized
* What environmental / sustainable variables are part of the Grid
* Supply-chain constraints

# The Open Grid

The Open Grid will be a living entity, with a circulatory system that stitches together all digital resources owned and managed by different entities
across many parts of the world,
and with a nervous system that facilitates collaboration between
all of these "local brains" that run and operate these connectivity systems.

The focus here is on sharing resources and
services. As a utility, it provides ubiquitous access to resources and
services on demand. The focus here is to acquire resources. In
combination, it is a facility that is being provided to applications
to help them achieve their goals while creating added value for
resource owners and operators. The Grid’s infrastructure is a
combination of operating system, cloud-computing, networking, and
distributed system including their management.

# OGA's Approach

The OGA assesses, monetizes, and evolves
various technologies including radio, web, compute, AI/ML and many more to achieve automation at global scale.
It defines key principles for the Open Grid,
identifies interoperable technologies that adhere to those principles,
instantiates those technologies in physical environments, and demonstrates their efficacy.
To accelerate time-to-market and innovate new public/private business models,
the OGA also partners with cities and municipalities to create Innovation Zones.

The organization also performs research,
including the production of economic impact reports
and addressable market models that members and municipalities can use
to predict opportunities and outcomes.

~~The OGA also builds reference architectures
and coordinates with its members to develop~~
The OGA guides development of reference architectures to facilitate
co-creation across multiple sectors contributing to the various
elements of the Grid stack for 
collaborative go-to-market
offerings. As the OGA proves out new technologies, it documents how
these technologies will impact cloud providers, developers, vendors,
communication service providers (CSPs), internet service providers
(ISPs), and end users.


# Introduction and Motivation

At its inception in Summer 2021,
the Open Grid Alliance sparked a groundswell of industry support
with its *Open Grid Manifesto* (https://bit.ly/Open-Grid-Manifesto).
By the end of the year, the organization had attracted over 30 founding member companies
and became a 501(c)4 non-profit organization.
By September 2022, the organization had formed its four key workstreams:
the Grid Think Tank, Grid Innovation Zone, Grid Industry Development and Grid Market Development.
Soon thereafter Las Vegas, Nevada was designated as the OGA’s first Innovation Zone,
which published the market analysis paper *Monetizing the Open Grid in Las Vegas* (https://bit.ly/monetizing-the-grid),
and demonstrated a real-time video conferencing system over 5G CBRS using Open Grid technologies.

# Call for Actions

The Open Grid can only come about through deep collaboration and open architectures.
While many Open Grid technologies are being implemented today,
it will be a decades-long journey of innovation that will touch all levels of the stack,
from fiber optics to AI-driven workload automation.

For hardware providers, the Open Grid provides close proximity
distributed datacenter locations with last mile connectivity to reach
the end customer.  For software providers, the Open Grid enables your
software stack to be pre-integrated into an end to end solution for
the enterprise customer.  For data center operators, being part of the
Open Grid increases your ability to reach end customer sites and help
the end customer finish their digital transformation by moving the
last workloads offsite. For last mile service providers, being part of
the Open Grid enhances your product offering and increases your
revenue stream with pre-integrated solutions offered through the Open
Grid.  The OGA invites you to join our efforts to make this vision of
evolving the Internet for a better future for everyone across the
globe!
