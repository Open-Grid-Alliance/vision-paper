# Mission & Vision

[//]: # (General: What does 'Internet' mean? Looks that my definition is different from the one used here?)
[//]: # ( => Service focused; single company own global service)

[//]: # (What does 'reachritecting the Internet' means?)
[//]: # (What is behind this?)
[//]: # ( => reformulate)
[//]: # ( => federated internet: e.g. Mastodon, Blockchain, ...)
[//]: # ( => charging, accounting and billing tbd.; key-words: micopayment)

[//]: # (IMHO this is adding some more functions, but not replacing the Internet?)
[//]: # (The 'worldwide shared platform' needs IMHO some explanations.)
[//]: # ( => common API / Interfaces)
[//]: # ( => single buy-in / decentralizes system)

[//]: # (It is not clear what the difference between the OGA solution and e.g. an already available product like Google Serverless is.)
[//]: # (What are the use cases? Are there also use cases like using power in the most efficient way? )
[//]: # ( => Vapor.io: look at their presentations)
[//]: # ( => What want people? education of children - business relevant; health-care)

The Open Grid Alliance (OGA) (http://opengridalliance.org) is a collaborative industry organization
focused on rearchitecting the Internet into a worldwide shared platform - namely, the Open Grid -
that dynamically distributes compute, data and intelligence to where application and services demand.

[//]: # (Should we add a sentence about the name? 'Open Grid' might be easiliy mistakes with power grid.)

[//]: # ( => Sven volunteers to re-formulate; all will review; target: next week's meeting)


[//]: # (The next sentence is more a markteing statement - and does still not explain technical details.)
[//]: # (   ... e.g. what is a 'Open Grid platform'?)
[//]: # (What does 'vendor-neutral' means? Open interfaces / APIs? What about interlectual properties?)
[//]: # ("commercial enterprises, non-profit organizations and academic institutions" is IMHO in contradiction to 'industry ordanization'.)

The OGA develops vendor-neutral solutions to evolve the Internet into a global, shared Open Grid platform,
supported by a global ecosystem of commercial enterprises, non-profit organizations and academic institutions.

[//]: # (Ask BoM: what *should* be the outcome? Architecture? Blueprint? API / Interface definitions? )


[//]: # (What is 'edge'? There is also one interpretation that the end users are part of the edge.)
[//]: # (Do I misunderstand something? How can economics be distributed?)
[//]: # (What are these 'classes of applications'? Where are they defined?)
[//]: # (Also the current setup of the Internet supports this - as it is already handled by some public-cloud products.)
[//]: # ( ... What is special for OGA?)
[//]: # (What is an 'intelligent device'?)
[//]: # (Will OGA provide new networking infrastructure? How?)
[//]: # (Suggestion: move everything starting from the second sentence to one section further down.)

By embracing technologies that distribute the economics and flexibility of the cloud
from centralized data centers through the network edge and all the way to end users,
the OGA makes it possible to build new classes of applications
that support billions of intelligent devices, the data that they generate,
and the new networking infrastructure that underpins their seamless operation.
The OGA welcomes leaders from many industries and disciplines,
leveraging domain expertise that spans the entire stack,
encompassing physical infrastructure (fiber, data centers, real estate, servers)
as well as the software-driven networking, compute abstraction, automation,
federation, and application layers.
The OGA also seeks out cross-sectional expertise in areas such as security, climate neutrality and resource efficiency.

# The Open Grid

[//]: # (This sounds like a marketing sloagan without any technical background.)

The Open Grid is the inevitable evolution of the Internet.


[//]: # (Who is 'our' and 'we'?)
[//]: # (Why does the current topology no longer provide for our needs?)
[//]: # (Why must the redesign start at the edge?)
[//]: # (Which services will the Open Grid provide [which are not already available]?)
[//]: # (What are 'next generation of applications'?)

The legacy Internet with its massively scaled data centers and its core-centric network topologies will no longer provide for our needs;
we must redesign our systems starting at the edge.
This new Open Grid will be a software-defined system
that stretches across the globe to support multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, near-prem and on-prem services
via fungible resources that are employed, when and where they are needed, on demand, and with service guarantees.
It combines all the necessary components including hardware, software, networking, and infrastructure technologies
to support the next generation of applications.

# Why the OGA is Needed

Today's Internet is primarily a communication vehicle; it is not yet ready for planet-scale automation.
What is needed is an openly developed and widely shared foundation for the development of personalized and intelligent solutions for everyone.
The Open Grid will be a living entity, with a circulatory system that stitches together all digital resources owned and managed by different entities
across many parts of the world,
and with a nervous system that facilitates collaboration between
all of these "local brains" that run and operate these connectivity systems.

To achieve this, we must devise new and recursive approaches
for planning, designing and operating these systems with high degrees of autonomy.
We must assess all these technological change vectors and harmonize them to build the Open Grid.

# How the OGA Operates

The OGA assesses, monetizes, and evolves
various technologies including radio, web, compute, AI/ML and many more to achieve automation at global scale.
It defines key principles for the Open Grid,
identifies interoperable technologies that adhere to those principles,
instantiates those technologies in physical environments, and demonstrates their efficacy.
To accelerate time-to-market and innovate new public/private business models,
the OGA also partners with cities and municipalities to create Innovation Zones.

The organization also performs research,
including the production of economic impact reports
and addressable market models that members and municipalities can use
to predict opportunities and outcomes.

The OGA also builds reference architectures
and coordinates with its members to develop collaborative go-to-market offerings.
As the OGA proves out new technologies,
it documents how these technologies will impact cloud providers, developers,
vendors, communication service providers (CSPs), internet service providers (ISPs), and end users.

# Introduction and Motivation

At its inception in Summer 2021,
the Open Grid Alliance sparked a groundswell of industry support
with its *Open Grid Manifesto* (https://bit.ly/Open-Grid-Manifesto).
By the end of the year, the organization had attracted over 30 founding member companies
and became a 501(c)4 non-profit organization.
By September 2022, the organization had formed its four key workstreams:
the Grid Think Tank, Grid Innovation Zone, Grid Industry Development and Grid Market Development.
Soon thereafter Las Vegas, Nevada was designated as the OGAâ€™s first Innovation Zone,
which published the market analysis paper *Monetizing the Open Grid in Las Vegas* (https://bit.ly/monetizing-the-grid),
and demonstrated a real-time video conferencing system over 5G CBRS using Open Grid technologies.

# Call for Actions

The Open Grid can only come about through deep collaboration and open architectures.
While many Open Grid technologies are being implemented today,
it will be a decades-long journey of innovation that will touch all levels of the stack,
from fiber optics to AI-driven workload automation.

The OGA therefore invites you all to join our effort to make its vision of evolving the Internet
to close the digital divide for a better future for everyone across the globe!
