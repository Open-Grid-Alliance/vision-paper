# Mission & Vision

The Open Grid Alliance (OGA) seeks to be this organization. 
It will include leaders from multiple industries and disciplines, 
leveraging domain expertise that spans the entire stack, 
encompassing the physical infrastructure as well as the software-driven networking, virtualization, automation, and application layers.

# Introduction and Motivation

The Open Grid Alliance (OGA) started in Summer 2021 looking to catalyze the emergence of edge infrastructure, 
5G networks and billions of IoT devices, the Grid is the next step in the evolution of the Internet. 
Globally distributed, the Grid weaves together a public and private fabric of compute, data and intelligence 
to enable contextually aware, immersive applications at the edge, on demand. 
The grid is an open architectures that will enable the dynamic and geo-distribution of workloads, 
evolving the internet to service the billions of devices and applications coming online.
Since its inception 30+ members have joined the OGA to jointly realize the vision. 
The path to realize the vision will be enable through four workstreams 
namely the Think Tank, Innovation Zone, Industry Development and Market Development 
through interactions within OGA as well as the global related ecosystem.

# The Grid
The Open Grid is the inevitable evolution of the internet. 
Our legacy internet with its massively scaled data centers and its core-centric network topologies will no longer provide for our needs; 
we must redesign our systems starting at the edge, augmenting today’s internet with new architectures 
that enable the rapid deployment of workloads and services to the right locations, for the right reasons, 
ensuring appropriate levels of latency, security, and resilience—and delivered at the right price, preferably at global scale. 
Like the power grid, from which it gathers its metaphorical inspiration, the Open Grid will be a software-defined system 
that stretches across the globe to support multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, near-prem and on-prem services 
via fungible resources that are employed, when and where they are needed, on demand, and with guarantees and SLAs. 
The Open Grid combines all the necessary components to support the next generation of applications. 
It is the purposeful integration of hardware, software, networking, and infrastructure technologies 
to support the next generation of emerging applications.

# Call for Actions

The Open Grid can only come about through deep collaboration and open architectures. While many Grid technologies are being implemented today, it will be a decades-long journey of innovation and it will touch all levels of the stack, from fiber optics to AI-driven workload automation.
